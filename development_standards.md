# Development Standards and Best Practices

This document outlines the standards and practices we will follow to ensure the "Pehance" project is high-quality, maintainable, and scalable.

## 1. Modularity

### Frontend (Next.js)

- **Component-Based Architecture**: All UI elements will be built as reusable React components.
- **Atomic Design Principles**: Components will be organized logically (e.g., atoms, molecules, organisms) to maintain a clean structure.
- **CSS Modules / Tailwind CSS**: We will use Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling to ensure styles are scoped and do not leak globally, preventing unintended side effects.

### Backend (Python)

- **Multi-Agent System**: The backend is designed as a collection of independent agents, each with a single responsibility (e.g., Intent Classifier, Guardrail Agent). This allows for individual agents to be updated or replaced without impacting the entire system.
- **Microservices-Oriented**: While not a full microservices architecture initially, the backend will be developed with the principle of service separation in mind, communicating with the frontend via a well-defined API.

## 2. API Design

- **RESTful Principles**: The API connecting the frontend and backend will follow RESTful conventions for clear, predictable communication.
- **Standardized JSON Responses**: All API responses will use a consistent JSON structure, including clear status indicators and error messages.

## 3. Code Quality & Consistency

- **Linter and Formatter**: We will use ESLint for TypeScript/JavaScript and a suitable linter/formatter (like Black) for Python to enforce a consistent code style and catch potential errors early.
- **Git Workflow**: We will follow a standard Git workflow (e.g., feature branches, pull requests) for organized development and code reviews.
- **Naming Conventions**: We will adhere to standard naming conventions for variables, functions, and classes in both Python (PEP 8) and JavaScript.

## 4. Web Standards & Accessibility

- **W3C Standards Compliance**: The application's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will adhere to the latest W3C recommendations to ensure cross-browser compatibility and interoperability.
- **Accessibility (WCAG)**: We are committed to meeting WCAG 2.1 AA standards. This includes:
  - Semantic HTML for clear structure.
  - Keyboard accessibility for all interactive elements.
  - Sufficient color contrast.
  - ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes where necessary.
  - Proper labels for all form inputs.

## 5. Future-Proofing

- **Environment Variables**: Configuration and API keys will be managed through environment variables, never hard-coded, to allow for easy changes between development, staging, and production environments.
- **Scalable Hosting**: Our choice of Vercel for the frontend and a container-based service like Render/Fly.io for the backend allows for independent scaling as user traffic grows.
