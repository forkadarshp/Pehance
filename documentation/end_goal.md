# Prompt Enhancer Pro - Project Specification

## Project Overview

**Theme**: Prompt Enhancer - "Pehance" (like Behance)

**Core Problem**: Help users write effective prompts on the first attempt rather than iterating multiple times, saving time and token costs. Provide real-time assistance during prompt writing (like Grammarly for prompts).

## Project Structure

### Part 1: Web Application

A web app that assists users in creating well-defined prompts with intelligent enhancement capabilities.

### Part 2: SDK with Sidecar Architecture

A real-time prompt assistance tool (browser extension, API service, mobile keyboard extension) that works wherever users write prompts.

## Web Application Specifications

### User Authentication & Access

- **Login**: Single Google SSO on the same page
- **API Keys**: Users can add their own keys or use available integrated models
- **Storage**: API keys stored in local storage on user's machine (no server-side storage)

### Core User Workflow

1. **Direct Input**: Primary prompt input box (required field)
2. **Output Sets**: User can choose to auto-generate or manually provide expected vs current output comparisons
3. **Optional Context**: Users can specify intent, use case, and settings
4. **Model Selection**: Dropdown to choose target AI model (GPT-4, Claude, DeepSeek, etc.)

### Enhancement Processing

#### Data Flow Architecture

**Minimal Input (prompt only)**:

1. Semantic analysis of prompt
2. Intent detection via LLM
3. Context inference for likely use case
4. Auto-generate single output set
5. Generate enhanced prompt with version 1.0

**Rich Input (additional context provided)**:

1. Process manual output sets/auto-generation requests
2. Integrate model selection and feedback data
3. Multi-output set analysis
4. Apply model-specific optimizations
5. Generate enhanced prompt with incremented version

#### Enhancement Approach

- **LLM-Based Enhancement**: Uses LLM to improve prompts rather than rule-based systems
- **Context Enrichment**: Provides LLM with additional data to overcome interpolation vs extrapolation limitations
- **Feedback Integration**: Uses good/bad feedback on output sets as additional context for future enhancements

### Multi-Model Support

#### Template Library System

1. **Super Prompt Library**: Universal best practices that work across all AI models
2. **Model-Specific Adaptation Layer**: Customizes universal patterns for specific models (GPT-4, Claude, DeepSeek, etc.)
3. **Fallback**: Default templates for models with insufficient optimization data

#### Model Selection Impact

- Templates adapt based on selected model
- Parameter recommendations change per model
- Enhancement strategies tailored to model-specific strengths/weaknesses

### Version Control

- Enhanced prompts include version tracking
- Users can see prompt evolution over time
- Ability to revert to previous versions
- Track which changes led to better outcomes

### Enhancement Output Modes

- **Inline Edits**: Targeted changes to specific parts
- **Complete Rewrites**: Comprehensive alternative versions
- **Explanations**: Brief explanations of changes made

### Feedback System

- **Binary Feedback**: Good/bad ratings on output sets
- **Learning Loop**: Feedback becomes additional context for future enhancements
- **Pattern Recognition**: System identifies what works/doesn't work across contexts
- **Cross-User Learning**: Feedback benefits all users while respecting individual preferences

### Quality Validation

- **Primary Metric**: Similarity scores between enhanced prompt outputs and expected outputs in output sets
- **Testing Logic**: If enhanced prompt doesn't improve similarity scores, the enhancement failed
- **Output Sets as Test Cases**: User-defined expected outputs serve as objective success criteria

## SDK/Sidecar Component

### Multi-Platform Support

- **Browser Extension**: Works across AI platforms (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
- **API Service**: For developer integration
- **Mobile Keyboard Extension**: Cross-app functionality on mobile

### Shared Backend Architecture

- **Modular Design**: Same core engine supports all platforms
- **Core Engine Layer**: Universal prompt analysis and enhancement
- **Interface Adapter Layer**: Handles platform-specific communication
- **Platform Integration Layer**: Manages unique requirements per platform

### Real-Time Features

- **Autocomplete Suggestions**: Task-specific, AI-optimized completions
- **Phrase Highlighting**: Visual indicators for ambiguity, vagueness, conflicts, missing context
- **Additional Features**:
  - Real-time quality metrics
  - Intent detection display
  - Format structure guides
  - Parameter recommendations
  - Context window utilization indicators

---

## Technical Architecture

### Enhancement Processing

- **LLM-Powered**: Core enhancement done by LLM with enriched context
- **Context Assembly**: Dynamically assembles relevant information (successful prompts, feedback patterns, gap analysis)
- **Web Access Integration**: Can fetch relevant articles/research when needed
- **Model-Specific Processing**: Adapts enhancement strategy based on target AI model

### Data Management

- **Feedback Storage**: Binary good/bad feedback with rich metadata (task type, model, enhancement techniques)
- **Pattern Aggregation**: Individual feedback aggregated into meaningful patterns
- **Confidence Scoring**: System develops confidence in different techniques over time
- **Cross-User Learning**: Global patterns while respecting individual preferences

---

## Business Model

### SaaS Freemium Structure

- **Free Tier**: 3 prompt enhancements per day
- **Pro Tier**: Unlimited enhancements + advanced features
- **Pricing Model**: Similar to v0.dev approach

### Cost Management

- **User-Controlled Costs**: Users can use their own API keys for direct cost control
- **Token Transparency**: Clear tracking of token usage per session
- **Cost Attribution**: Users see exactly where their tokens are consumed

---

## Analytics & Metrics

### Token-Focused Analytics

- **Session Tracking**: Current session token usage in real-time
- **Cost Breakdown**: Per call, per session, per prompt costs
- **Historical Usage**: Daily/weekly/monthly consumption patterns
- **Model Comparison**: Token efficiency across different AI models

### UI Design

- Simple bar design showing:
  - Per Call costs
  - Per Session costs
  - Per Prompt costs
- Real-time updates as user performs actions
- Model-specific cost calculations

---

## Deployment Strategy

### Recommended Approach

- **Frontend**: Vercel free tier with Next.js
- **Benefits**: Zero maintenance, built-in CI/CD, optimized for Next.js, global CDN
- **Scaling Path**: Easy transition to paid plans as usage grows
- **Domain**: Custom domain (~100 Rs) connected to Vercel

### Infrastructure Considerations

- **Local Storage**: API keys stored client-side
- **Serverless Functions**: Handle enhancement logic efficiently
- **Global Distribution**: CDN for optimal performance
